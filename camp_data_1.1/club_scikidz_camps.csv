Since computer programming is considered the new literacy, young people now have an opportunity to put together multimedia programs without any previous programming knowledge. As children create with Scratch, they learn to think creatively, work collaboratively, and reason systematically.

WOW! Some of the added features include a search light design on the gripper and a safety gear audible indicator is included on all five gear boxes to prevent any potential injury or gear breakage during operation.

The second robot your camper will build is a multi-function solar powered robot from our partner Nasco called the SolarBot. If your children are glued to smart-phones, give them an opportunity to acquire solar power knowledge, learn about mechanical transmissions, and get them outside to play. Using a compact solar panel, these bots harness energy from the sun to power an electric motor. Campers can build a drummer that marches along, beating a drum, an armadillo robot that does somersaults, a bug that crawls on six legs, and more. Amazingly, you might find yourself engaged in conversation with your child, thanks to their newly acquired “expertise”!


Both of these robot kits allow campers to create and recreate: Put it together, take it apart, make another module…It’s all about flexibility, problem solving, and intelligent thinking. But luckily, kids don’t have to be advanced engineers to create and achieve. With both robots, they learn as they play!

If times allows, campers will learn how to solder on Friday with the help of the perennial favorite “Blinky Robot.” Your camper will have a blast learning how to build their robots- they’ll be SO proud to show off their hard work on Friday!
